# 2019_USBasp
2019 edition of a breadboard USBasp AVR programmer

This is just a quick upload place for my project around an USBasp AVR programmer 
based on the circuit used by Thomas Fischl, but easily placeable on a standard
breadboard.

Becuase of some design choices small adaptions to the firmware were necessary, 
a plan could be to merge the hardware layout with another firmware like

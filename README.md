# 2019_USBasp
2019 edition of a breadboard USBasp AVR programmer

This is just a quick upload place for my project around an USBasp AVR programmer 
based on the circuit used by Thomas Fischl, but easily placeable on a standard
breadboard.

The necessary gerber files for pcb manufacturing can be found in the folder "production"

A plan could be to merge the hardware layout with another firmware like
https://github.com/mariusgreuel/USBasp

The original firmware from Thomas Fischl can be used
